## DISCLAIMER

Site is still in very early stages, there is almost no content. 
Content and functionality updates will be pushed daily.

## IDEA

I love my mom, but my mom doesn't love learning english, everytime we're abroad
she doesn't use english cause she's scared and I do the talking. 
This site is a byproduct of me trying to teach my mom a bit of foreign language, and hopefully we can create free, open-source, fast growing plarform that allows people to learn english - the free, friendly and *cool* way.

## TO DO

- [ ] Add tests logic
- [ ] Add login option and database (firebase/pocketbase)
- [x] Add missing lessons content 
- [x] Add flashcards
- [ ] Add teacher user logic and assignments
- [x] Check if footer goes crazy as always (it doesn't)
- [ ] (*far future*) Translate site from polish to other languages
- [x] Fix sidebar UI/UX (i guess?)
