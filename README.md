## DISCLAIMER

Site is still in very early stages, there is almost no content. 
Content and functionality updates will be pushed daily.

## IDEA

I love my mom, but my mom doesn't love learning english, everytime we're abroad
she doesn't use english cause she's scared and I do the talking. 
This site is a byproduct of me trying to teach my mom a bit of foreign language, and hopefully we can create free, open-source, fast growing plarform that allows people to learn english - the free, friendly and *cool* way.

## TO DO

1. Add tests logic
2. Add login option and database (firebase?)
3. Add missing lessons content 
4. Add flashccards
5. Addteacher user logic and assignments
6. Check if footer goes crazy as always
7. (*far future*) Translate site from polish to other languages

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
